Probability Problem - Pretend Poisson Processes

A teaching resource for advanced probability. Intended as a revision of the contents of MIT's excellent postgraduate course in probability, delivered by Professor John Tsitsiklis. The course is part of MIT's Data Science MicroMasters, and is available here https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data. (As this includes some concepts from the Statistics course in the Data Science MicroMasters, it may be best suited for preparation for the Capstone exam).  

The notebook tries to develop intuition and understanding of not only the "facts" such as the different distributions covered, QQ plots, Bayes rule etc, but also the "feelings" of how to best approach a problem, by considering several methods and looking at the pros and cons of each.  

I hope you will find it interesting, and would be happy to receive any feedback - feel free to connect and send me a message at www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-kissin/
